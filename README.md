# Social Network System for Job Placement

In this project, you’ll create a web application that connects recruiters and potential candidates. In essence, it would be a social network that enables people to communicate with each other and thus find suitable opportunities. You can take inspiration from major social media platforms such as LinkedIn and Facebook. Facebook is based on PHP, so you can easily imitate some of its features.

1. The platform would allow recruiters to post a job opening along with its description and other details.
2. The system would require the following functionalities to work optimally:
   • A registration window where a person can join the network
   • An option of responding to posts so people can share their opinion through comments or other methods (such as ‘Likes’)
   • An option to post images
   • The admin would be responsible for allowing a person to start an account on the platform.
   • A chatting system so one user can talk with another.
